# City-Finder
A Software that retrieved Google's data to give info about the city that we searched for.

How to make it work:
1- You have to get a Google API. (If you don't know how to get. search on youtube how to)
2- After getting API for example your API is "asd35SD4sdf6FD3d41JKgdfDFd"
3- Replace the API with "YOUR-API-HERE" here in the code (api_key = '&key=YOUR-API-HERE')
4- save it and run and enjoy :)
5- if there's any problem. contact me here "http://fb.com/noman.abid.370"
