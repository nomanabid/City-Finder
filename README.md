# City-Finder
City Finder is a software that retrieves Google's data to give info about the city that we searched for and automatically saves it's latitude and longitude in the database.txt after every search.

HOW TO MAKE THIS CODE WORK FOR YOU:

1- You have to download "Qt Designer Open Source" 
(from here "https://www.qt.io/download")

2- You have to install Packages for Pyton as given below:
(PyQt4, json, urllib) Note: pip install will work or else search on youtube "how to install packages with pip in python"

3- You have to get a Google API. (If you don't know how to get. search on youtube how to)
4- After getting API for example your API is "aJ35SD4sdf6FD3d41JKgdfDFd"
5- Replace the API with "YOUR-API-HERE" here in the code (api_key = '&key=YOUR-API-HERE')
(You'll get this code in 11th line in CityFinder.py "JUST PASTE YOUR API THERE")

6- save it and run and enjoy :)
